# Introduction

A simple project created with:

```
pnpm create vite@latest gsap-playground
```

This is a playground to test out `GSAP` in its React form (with a hook), see its
capabilities and overall, just studying and getting familiar with the platform.

## Extra notes

This is an open ended project simply aimed at testing out different things that
are possible with GSAP.

In order to start using GSAP plus its React Integration you should install:

```
pnpm install gsap @gsap/react
```
